  You are an expert researcher and paper reviewer. Please read the attached paper carefully and generate a comprehensive research report in English.

  Critical Instructions:
  - **Technical Depth**: Avoid superficial summaries. Include necessary technical details, mathematical formulations, specific hyperparameters, and concrete examples from the paper.
  - **Format**: Use Markdown, including bolding key terms and using tables for experiment results.

  Report Structure:

  1. **The Core Challenge**: Summary of the problem, why it is scientifically important, and the specific difficulty/gap this paper addresses.
  2. **Overview of Approach**: Detailed overview of the model architecture, training techniques, data pipeline, and novel mechanisms. Can be split to 2 pages if it's too long.
  3. **Technical Implementation Details**: Key algorithms, loss functions, or mathematical proofs essential to the method.
  4. **What do experiments show**: Summarize results using a Markdown Table to compare with baselines. What specifically do the numbers show?
  5. **Key Insight**: The single most transferable and innovative idea behind this paper—the "Aha!" moment.
  6. **Key Strengths and Limitations**: Key strengths vs. limitations/edge cases.
  7. **Future Trajectories**: Where can this research go next?
  8. **One potential paper improvement**: One concrete, technical suggestion you would make to improve this work.
  9. **Interesting follow-up references**: List interesting follow-up references mentioned in the paper.

  IMPORTANT: Output as JSON array. Each section becomes one note with 'title' and 'content' (full markdown text). Example:
  [
    {"title": "The Core Challenge", "content": "...full markdown content..."},
    {"title": "Overview of Approach", "content": "...full markdown content..."},
    ...
